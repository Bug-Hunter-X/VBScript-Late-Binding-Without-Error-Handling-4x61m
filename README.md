This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: using late binding without proper error handling.  Late binding, while convenient, can lead to runtime errors if the object being accessed doesn't exist or doesn't have the expected properties.  This example shows how to improve the code to avoid these issues.  The `bug.vbs` file demonstrates the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version.
